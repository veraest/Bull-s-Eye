# Bull-s-Eye

This is a simple game which i recreated for swift learning.

Bull's Eye is a basic iOS application developed using Swift. It's a fairly simple app - a number is randomly generated, the player has to place a bull's eye on a slider, and they earn points based on how close the bull's eye is to the number. The player can continue to play and accumulate points and can also reset the game.
